# Project 1: FOODAPEDIA


<h2 style= "color: green; font-weight: bold;">
  Project Proposal
</h2>


Using server APIs from Recipe - Food - Nutrition, we will be building an application that will provide recipes/ideas based on the list of ingridients that he user provide. Once you get the recepi of your choice, foodapedia will suggest the wine to pair with your meal... ENJOY!! 

<br />

## :heavy_check_mark: User Story


* As a user, I can enter a set of ingredients that they want to work with and the application will provide suggestions of meals or recipes.

* As a user, when they click on the recipe/meal it will prompt you to a picture of it and the application will suggest wines to pair with your meal.

* For future realeases, the applicaiton will provide, dietary options, location of the nearest grocey/liquor stores.
